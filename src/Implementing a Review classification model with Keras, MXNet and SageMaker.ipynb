    "#### Data set: Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Amazon Customer Reviews (a.k.a. Product Reviews) is one of Amazon’s iconic products. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. Over 130+ million customer reviews are available to researchers as part of this dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "   1. The Review classficiation is NLP machine learning model to predict whether a review posted by the customer is positive or negative. For the sake of simplification, we have converted the ratings provided by the customer into a binary target variable with value equals to 1 when ratings were either 4 or 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "   2. In present work, after spilitting the data into train and test we created a feature engineerng pipeline on training data using natural language processing techiniques. The dataset was futher split into 10 chunks to demonstrate distributed learning, where during training not more than 1204 [batch_size] records are loaded onto memory at a time.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "####  Setup\n",
    "This notebook was created and tested on an ml.p2.xlarge notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data. This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "2. The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these. Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the get_execution_role() call with the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "     1. If I could give this less than 1 star I would.  The worst movie I've seen in ages.  The acting was less than high school level.  The Mockingjay character was mind numbingly boring and droll.  She was terrible.  The characters were beyond pathetic.  1 hour and 40 minutes of pure torture and inane plot, script combined with terrible CGI and effects I found myself wanting to consume mass quantities of alcohol.  The whole Hunger Game sage is a total waste of time.  How anyone can say this is anything but pure boredom is beyond me.\n",
